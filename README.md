# GIS6345 Week 6
The exercises this week were a little more challenging. In 11.1, I was able to create the dictionary by following the for loop logic and making the count the index. I had some trouble understanding how the dictionary function worked at first but working through this problem helped me gain a better understanding of it. In 12.1, I first tried to use a tuple to split the letters up, but realized that it would include punctuation as well. Once I figured out that I could use a dictionary to index the letters and then count the occurances of the letters, I was able to figure out how to create the function. I can see how the dictionary can be useful for other applications because it creates an easy way to organize and store information.
